Map-Reduce Framework 
Matt Sebek - msebek@

To run this project, first build it from source. 
The main "runner" files are located in Src, and
are called:

(Note: all of these should be run from the top-level project directory, 
       so the tablets can be found appropriately.)

- MainMain - starts up a whole cluster as threads, since this
             is much easier than spinning them up individually

- MainJustServer - start a default server instance (and a local pair of 
             map and reduce workers, who don't have all the tablets)

     To run this:
     $ rmiregistry 15214 & ; this will start an external RMI registry...hoped I could avoid
                        this, but no dice. Bit disappointed with RMI for this.
     $ java -classpath bin MainJustServer

             Additional options for this program:
	      None. Note that you will need the hostname for this machine, 
                    in order to pass it to the workers. 

- MainJustWorkers
      Default:
      java -classpath bin MainJustWorkers
             Spin up a complementary set of clients, that together with the
             worker from the master server, will have a full set of tablets, 
	     and will begin map-reduce

      java -classpath bin MainJustWorkers 128.123.456.897
             Spin up complementary set of workers who will search for a host
             at the given hostname/ip.

      java bin/MainJustClient
             If you're feeling masochistic, you can spin up workers individually.
      java -classpath bin MainJustWorkers uniqueServerName 
                                           uniqueServePort masterHostname  "1,2,3"


- PrefixGuess/Wordcount
      java -classpath bin PrefixGuess 123.456.678.967 (master server IP/hostname)

If things get weird, just modify these .java files directly, it's basically as hard
and much more flexible. But you shouldn't need to.
